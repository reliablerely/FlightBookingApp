# FlightBookingApp
This is a Flight booking app API built on Express module

##
The codes are structured into three folders of Models, Controllers and Routes with index.js isolated
The Model folder serves more like a schema model for the database flow
The Route folder contains the file where all the routes in the app are declared
The Controller is the engine of the app. It contains the file where all the logics of the app are declared and defined

The app performs five tasks: Getting all available flights;
Booking/Adding a flight;
getting a single flight;
Updating/editing an existing flight and 
deleting a particular flight.
